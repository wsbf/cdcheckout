This software was designed as a project for CpSc 372 by David A. Cohen II.
It is intended for use by WSBF-FM for DJs to check out albums for review and
from the library. 

############    Requirements:    ############
- Python 2 (Written and tested using 2.6.5 and 2.7.3)
- MySQLdb (python module)
- Tkinter
- ttk (included in this package)

############    Credentials for testing:     ############
Username: _TestUser
Password: password

############    Usage    ############
This application can be run from the build directory in two possible ways:
[1] Use the following commmand for each launch:
$	python ./main.py 

or, [2] Run the following command before the first run:
$	chmod +x main.py
and then you may use the following command to launch:
$   ./main.py

###########   Other Comments   ###########
This application uses a modified form of the Model-View-Controller architecture.
main.py instantiates the main controller, which creates the main view. 
The main view instantiates the two frames of the notebook (review/library check-
out), and the controllers are instantiated from these views. This was done 
intentionally for several reasons, one of which is that these views inherit from
tk.Frame, so instantiating these from the main controller would cause coupling.

###########   Credits   ############
- A good bit of the TreeView Code was taken from the example python-ttk code
